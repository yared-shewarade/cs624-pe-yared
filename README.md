GitHub Codespaces is used as a cloud development environment for the development of mobile application using Expo. It runs directly in the browser to build, test, and debug mobile application code. Expo is a tool that simplifies the process of building ad deploying cross-platform mobile apps.
There is a general procedure for getting started with Expo:
1.	Install Node.js on your computer if you are using local repository.
2.	Install the Expo CLI by running the following code in the terminal.
        npm install -g expo-cli
3.	Create a new Expo project by running the following command.
        expo init HelloWorld
This will create a new directory called “HelloWord” with a basic Expo project structure.
4.	Navigate into the project directory:
        cd HelloWorld
5.	Open App.js and make changes to this app code. I added three lines as:
            Yared Shewarade
                MSCS
                STC
6.	Start the Expo development server by running the following command:
expo start
7.	Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the app store.
8.	Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer tools which will load your app on your mobile device.
