I used React NAtive to develop mobile app. t is an an open source that used to design for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS, Android, and Web. It is based on React and brings all its glory to mobile app development.
I followed the following procedure to create mobile app:
1.	Install Node.js on your computer if you are using local repository.
2.	Install the Expo CLI by running the following code in the terminal.

                npm install -g expo-cli
3.	Create a new Expo project by running the following command.

                expo init PE02-CoreComponents
This will create a new directory called “HelloWord” with a basic Expo project structure.
4.	Navigate into the project directory:

                cd CoreComponents
5.	Open App.js and make changes to this app code. I added three lines as:

6.	Start the Expo development server by running the following command:

                expo start
7.	Install the Expo Go app on your mobile device from the app store.
8.	Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the Expo Developer tools which will load your app on your mobile device.
